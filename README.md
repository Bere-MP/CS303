This program ask the user for the file name and using their input, searches for 
the file and reads the data file provided from the user and asks four options to 
make any changes to the program. The options are displayed on screen. There are
four functions. The Search option takes in the integer provided by the user, 
searchs the index number of the integer and returns the index number. The Modify 
option takes in two inputs, the index number and new number that are provided by 
the user. The Add function adds the integer provided by the user at the end of 
the vector. The Remove function removes the number from the index provided by the 
user. Each function will terminate program if the input provided by the user
is in a different type (like inputing a string into a integer function). After 
an option is choosen and run, it will display the updated vector on screen and 
asks if the user would like to make any additional changes. If the user does not
want to make any more changes to the vector, choosing option E will break the 
while loop, ending the program.
